## User Cases
I picture this app being used by two types of users:
1. Users who want to find artists with upcoming shows in their area.
2. Users who want to find when their favorite artists will have a concert near them.

## Working Prototype
You can access a working prototype of the app here: [Investment Simulator - Beta](https://investment-simulator-capstone.herokuapp.com/)

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* Every User has the ability to create an account with multiple artists that they can "follow"
* Every user can also search artists that they don't follow and find out when those artists' concerts are


## Technology
* Front-End: React | Redux | CSS3  | Javascript | XML
* Back-End: Node.js | Express.js | Mocha | Chai | RESTful API Endpoints | MongoDB | Mongoose



## Responsive
App is strongly built to be usuable on mobile devices, as well as responsive across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screen resolutions.

## Development Roadmap
This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* Use the users location to automatically display the followed artists next shows near them
